Hi there, everyone. My name's Sri. I'm currently a developer at Datto Inc, where I work on our Linux agent. In the past, I've been a software consultant, erstwhile researcher, fly-by-night web developer, and temporary security analyst. Writing it out like that makes it sound much more impressive than it should, honestly. At heart I'm just a guy who's way too into computers and has trouble saying "no" to things.


In my free time, I enjoy breaking computers in various ways and fixing them, along with wandering around outside taking subpar photos on my phone of natural landmarks. I also enjoy a rousing few games of Hearthstone every now and again.

If you'd like to contact me, it's probably best to email me at <a href="mailto:thisguy@sriramanujam.me">thisguy@sriramanujam.me</a>. It's just about the only form of communication that I'm guaranteed to see. You could also try tweeting me at <a href="https://twitter.com/Happy_Man">@Happy_Man</a>, though it's far less likely that I'll see it.
